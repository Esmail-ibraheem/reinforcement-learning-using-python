In this tutorial series, we are going through every step of building an expert Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that is capable of playing games.

This series is divided into three parts:

* **Part 1**: Designing and Building the Game Environment. In this part we will build a game environment and customize it to make the RL agent able to train on it.

* **Part 2**: Build and Train the Deep Q Neural Network (DQN). In this part, we define and build the different layers of DQN and train it.

* **Part 3**: Test and Play the Game.

We might also try making another simple game environment and use Q-Learning to create an agent that can play this simple game.

## The Motivation:

One time I was in the rabbit hole of YouTube and [THIS VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-rWB1jOt9s) was recommended to me, it was about the **sense of self **in human babies, after watching the video a similar question popped into my mind* “Can I develop a smart agent that is smart enough to have a sense of its body and has the ability to change its features to accomplish a certain task?”*

This series is my way of answering this question.
